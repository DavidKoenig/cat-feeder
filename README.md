catfeeder
=========
Software and tutorial to build an automatic web-controlled cat feeder with the RaspberryPi. 

# What is this and why?
Some cat owners (mostly with flat-only cats) know the problem: You are one or two days not at home. 
Your cat has enough water, enough toilets with sand filled, etc., but when your cat sees food it will eat it immediately. 
In many countries you just get a programmable cat feeder with day and time setting, but you get no chance to connect it 
anywhere and build your own interface.

This is a software (and tutorial - see link below) for your own automatic cat feeder which you can control over a secured webinterface.
If you make it accessible from outside you can feed your cat from everywhere when you are not at home.

# How does it work?

This cat feeder is located in a self-made wood-box and in it is a meat chopper without blades, that holds dry food for cats.
The meat chopper is plugged in a wireless socket which gets controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The Pi sets the wireless socket
on and off in a time that you can control via the web interface, so that you can portioning it. In the box there is a
hole where the food drops out. If you install the light barrier there is another hole where the cat can put something in, e.g. 
a textile mouse, to get food reward.
