catfeeder
=========
Software for an automatic web-controlled cat feeder built with RaspberryPi. 

# What is this and why?
Some cat owners (mostly with flat-only cats) know the problem: You are one or two days not at home. 
Your cat has enough water, enough toilets with sand filled, etc., but when your cat sees food it will eat it immediately. 
In many countries you just get a programmable cat feeder with day and time setting, but you get no chance to connect it 
anywhere and build your own interface.

This is a software (and tutorial - see link below) for your own automatic cat feeder which you can control over a secured webinterface.
If you make it accessible from outside you can feed your cat from everywhere when you are not at home.
